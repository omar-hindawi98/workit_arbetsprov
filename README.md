# CityPop
This project was created to serve as an example of how to solve the assignment given by We Know It.
The project runs on React.js and is tasked to use geonames API for fetching information about countries and cities.
In specific, it queries top 5 most populated cities of a country, whilst also displaying the population for the given city.

## Running the project
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It optimizes the code for best performance in production mode.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

The builded files can then be run on a webservice for production.
